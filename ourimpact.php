			<h2>Shaping Young Minds: 100 Scholars Program</h2>
			<p>He Cares Foundation is a Christian non-profit organization that works to alleviate the suffering of poor street children in metropolitan Manila by providing clothing, food, education, medical assistance, and spiritual support.

			<p>On November 8, 2013, Typhoon Yolanda devastated portion of Southeast Asia, particularly in Leyte and Eastern Samar, damaging 90% of the school infrastructures in the region. In response, JIZF focused their advocacy to rebuild schools, leading them to form a local core group of builders to construct nine schools in Tacloban and one in Maguindanao.</p>
			<p>With the help of MFT Group JIZF was able to complete the construction of Doña Brigida Elementary School in three months. This is in line with the group’s 100 Schools program which focuses on helping to solve the nation’s recurring problem on large gap in student-classroom ratio, plaguing the increase of classroom shortage. </p>
